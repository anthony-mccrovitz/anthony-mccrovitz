### Anthony McCrovitz

I'm a student at Purdue University West Lafayette studying Computer Science, with the hopes of becoming a Software Engineer. My interest range from front-end devlop, Arifical Intelligence/Machine Learning, IOS App Development. All projects are built from the ground up, from the planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. My goal with any project is learn new skills, but also mostt importantly brush up on the basics.
